# Longs Peak via the Old Cable's Route 
***
The highest mountain in Northern Colorado, Longs Peak, stands 14,259 feet high and sits inside of Rocky Mountain National Park. This mountain draws people from around the world to hike, climb, and summit its peak. If you have already been up on any part of this mountain, ie. Chasm Lake at the base of the East face, to its neighboring peaks, or even summited it via the Keyhole route and want to take the next step in approaching this mountain, climbing the Old Cable’s Route on the North face might be right for you. This guide will provide details on when to go, what you need, how to prepare, and the logistics of the climb itself.

# What You Need 
Assuming you have the basics for an alpine hike (proper clothes, water, food), some additional items you will need for this route are:
•	Preferably approach shoes; a mix between a hiking boot and a lighter climbing shoe. 
•	A light alpine rack.
•	Harness.
•	One 60/70m rope - if going in a larger group, bring two!
•	C4 cams.
•	Time! Allot for 8-14 hours.

# How to Prepare 
The most important element to prepare for is the altitude. If you’re coming from the Front Range, you will likely be fine but spending at least a day up in Estes Park would be beneficial. If coming from further away, adjust longer. 

Consider hiking another fourteener if you haven’t already. Going up Longs via the Keyhole route is a good way to familiarize yourself with the mountain before you rope up onto it. Having a climbing background is not required, though recommended. Being physically capable and willing to make it up two pitches rated at Class III will likely be enough to get you there. 

# The Climb
***
## Starting Off
Since this is a 16+ mile hike, you’ll want to start early. To have an estimate of total time needed on the trail, take your pace times the sixteen miles, multiply by two, then add two more hours on for good measure. You should leave somewhere between one and four in the morning in order to get back down before afternoon storms. 

The first half of the hike is just gaining mileage and altitude. You will turn around many a switchback for 2.5 miles, and quickly find yourself above tree line before the sun breaks. When you reach the Chasm Junction, use the privy if you feel so inclined, then go to the right to curve around Mount Lady Washington. Another mile later will be the junction at Battle Mountain where you’ll follow the sign to the left. Use this last section before the Boulderfield to make up for any lost time, dawn should be breaking around this fifth mile. 

## Rock-Hopping 
Here’s where the real fun begins. As you start rock-hopping while approaching the big, bad Boulderfield, you get to take the path less traveled. Most everyone that has made it this far will likely head straight for the Keyhole, but you’ll veer left towards Longs’s North face. Plan to slow down significantly as you trek over some massive boulders. Pictured below is the Keyhole to the right of our route.

You’ll see an outcropping that overlooks the East face, appropriately called Chasm View. Aim for this and (cautiously) enjoy the view.

Press on to the base of the climb - look for the route that lies between two distinct gulleys in the rock.

## Roping Up
The climb can be done in two pitches, but one is preferable. Rope up and tie in to the visible (and historical!) eyebolt.

You’ll have about 140’ of rock to climb, with an option for a second pitch right in the middle to split it up if need be. The whole route is rated at an *"easy"* 5.4. The first 40’ feet are full of good hand and feet holds. There will be an awkward maneuver in here (depending on how long your limbs are) to get onto the next ledge. Use this space to rest or regroup before starting on the next 70’. 
The second half is a bit easier, make sure to utilize your feet and use small cams. If you’ve made it to this point, I'd hope you're not afraid of heights, so use this opportunity to *look down!*

Once you've made it to the belay bolt ledge, follow the ridge to the left and help/wait for your crew to get up. The final ascent to the summit requires some class III scrambling, with a variety of cairns to follow. If you've ever made the trudge up The Trough on the West side, this scramble will feel luxurious in comparison! Summit and congratulate yourself! Enjoy the view, refuel, take a nap, but be mindful of time. The descent will still take some time. 

Here's the view of the scramble just above the face of the Diamond:
