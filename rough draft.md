# Longs Peak 
The highest mountain in Northern Colorado, Longs Peak, stands at 14, 259 feet and sits inside of Rocky Mountain National Park. Its majesty draws people from around the world. If you have already been up on any part of this mountain, ie. Chasm Lake at the base of the East face, to its neighboring peaks, or even summited Longs via the Keyhole route and want to take the next step in approaching this mountain, the Old Cable’s Route might be right for you. This guide will provide details on when to go, what you need, how to prepare, and the logistics of the climb itself.

# What You Need 
Assuming you have the basics for an alpine hike (proper clothes, water, food), some additional items you will need for this route are:
•	The right pair of shoes. Consider approach shoes – a mix between a hiking boot and a lighter climbing shoe. 
•	A light alpine rack 
•	Harness
•	One 60/70m rope (if going in a larger group, bring two!)
•	C4 cams
•	Time! Allot for 8-14 hours.

# How to Prepare 
Most importantly, prepare for the altitude. If you’re coming from the Front Range, you will likely be fine but spending at least a day up in Estes Park would be beneficial. If coming from further away, adjust longer. 

Consider hiking another fourteener if you haven’t already. Going up Longs via the Keyhole route is a good way to familiarize yourself with the mountain before you rope up onto it.
