# Longs Peak via the Old Cable's Route 
***
The highest mountain in Northern Colorado, Longs Peak, stands 14,259 feet high and sits inside of Rocky Mountain National Park. This mountain draws people from around the world to hike, climb, and summit its peak. If you have already been up on any part of this mountain, ie. Chasm Lake at the base of the East face, to its neighboring peaks, or even summited it via the Keyhole route and want to take the next step in approaching this mountain, the Old Cable’s Route might be right for you. This guide will provide details on when to go, what you need, how to prepare, and the logistics of the climb itself.

# What You Need 
Assuming you have the basics for an alpine hike (proper clothes, water, food), some additional items you will need for this route are:

•	Preferably approach shoes; a mix between a hiking boot and a lighter climbing shoe. 

•	A light alpine rack.

•	Harness.

•	One 60/70m rope - if going in a larger group, bring two!

•	C4 cams.

•	Time! Allot for 8-14 hours.

# How to Prepare 
The most important element to prepare for is the altitude. If you’re coming from the Front Range, you will likely be fine but spending at least a day up in Estes Park would be beneficial. If coming from further away, adjust longer. 

Consider hiking another fourteener if you haven’t already. Going up Longs via the Keyhole route is a good way to familiarize yourself with the mountain before you rope up onto it. Having a climbing background is not required, though recommended. Being physically capable and willing to make it up two pitches rated at Class III will likely be enough to get you there. 

# The Climb

## Starting Off
Since this is a 16+ mile hike, you’ll want to start early. To have an estimate of total time needed on the trail, take your pace times the sixteen miles, multiply by two, then add two more hours on for good measure. You should leave somewhere between one and four in the morning in order to get back down before afternoon storms. 

The first half of the hike is just gaining mileage and altitude. You will turn around many a switchback for 2.5 miles, and quickly find yourself above tree line before the sun breaks. The next five miles should be smooth sailing. When you reach the Chasm Junction, use the privy if you feel so inclined, then go to the right to curve around Mount Lady Washington.
