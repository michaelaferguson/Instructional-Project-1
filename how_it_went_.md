I quite liked this project! Likely due to the fact that I was able to pick a subject matter I enjoy so much. The resources we looked at as a class were helpful in understanding how to properly identify and address a particular audience. The topic submission was a little late in my opinion; I waited to write anything until it was approved and then I felt a little rushed to have a good piece of work by the peer review day. Working with markdown took some practice, and I definitely utilized google during the process. A worksheet with some of the basic shortcuts might be a helpful resource for next time. But I enjoyed the process, and it made the final result that much more rewarding.
